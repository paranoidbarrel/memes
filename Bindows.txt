Repeat it with me:
Windows will be a web service, and all your data will be on Microsoft's Servers.

You will be dependent and "happy". they can do every crap they want.
And you will pay for this Fubar, with an Subscription, they can rise at any point.
Linux will so never be a real competition, cause they now can blackmail you with your data.
